_Work in progress, alpha version 0.1_

_All books that I read in my career. Nothing to brag about, just a quick inventory of interesting resources, and a few words of feedback,
and maybe recommendations if the book is extraordinary. It's also to see in which area I read books, and discover what I can read next_
