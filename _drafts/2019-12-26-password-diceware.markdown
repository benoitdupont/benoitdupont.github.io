_Work in progress, alpha version 0.1_

Or the art of effectively choose passwords. 

It all began for me with a nagging sense that I did not handle my passwords correctly, with the following bad practices
* Mix private and professional passwords 
* Over rely on a strong password, but old, and with a number variation to bypass the renewal policy

I use several password with different Strengh, for easy websites (one time passwords) to production stuff.

I use Keypass at work, because there are too much password to remember. 

Using auto generated password is nice for good strenght password, but I don't want to rely on a password manager
* what if it's compromised ?
* what if I loose access ?

I prefer something from my memory...

Then somehow I got to this: https://xkcd.com/936/

Which introduced me to diceware: http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html

Which is the subject of the day :-)
