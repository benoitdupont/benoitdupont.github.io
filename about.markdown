# Who am I ?

Hello, my name is Benoit Dupont, I'm a software engineer living in Belgium and proud father of two little girls.
I like software development, especially Java and it's ecosystem. 

![That's me!](/assets/profile.png)


Here's my [CV](/assets/CV_Benoit_Dupont.pdf) and in the next section, a more comprehensive list 
of projects and technologies that I did in the past.

I especially love 
* developing on the backend side of applications, that's where there are the more interesting challenges for me 
* the book Clean Code which brought me many things to improve my development skills
* the Open Source philosophy, which is the way to go to build software quality
* the Testing Driven Development, that I cannot not use anymore on my projects
* the Agile methodology, without exaggeration it avoid a lot of tedious procedures and focus on code delivery
* pair programming and peer reviewing, because working together with other people is so efficient and an opportunity to grow professionally
* remote working, because we loose everyday too much time with commuting, and working with an international team is a really nice challenge

# What cool projects did I do ?

* I started writing a [blog](https://benoitdupont.github.io) to share my thoughts and personal experience on software development  
* I like very much the project [AssertJ](https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/), which is the first Open Source project which I contributed to.
* I'm writing my own [demo application:Tinkin](https://github.com/benoitdupont/tinkin) to get the opportunity to play with various frameworks.
* Lot of product development and maintenance for a big HealthCare government company
  * Apps on application server like JBoss and Weblogic 
  * Apps on Spring Boot
  * Webservices SOAP and Rest, with security and high availability
  * Batches with Spring Batch
  * UI development with Vaadin, Javascript and JSF
* Migration of apps from IaaS to PaaS, on Openshift 
* Migration of apps from VM's to IaaS
* Performance investigations and code optimization
* R&D framework development
* On site client product integration 
* And many more things like 
  * Pair programming, peer reviewing
  * Presentation of in-house company demo's and formations
  * Confluence management
  * Jenkins configuration
  * Sonar configuration
  * Linux basic administration
  * Custom scripting
  * ...
