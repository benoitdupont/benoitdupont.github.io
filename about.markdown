# Who am I ?

Hello, my name is Benoit Dupont, I'm a Software Engineer living in Belgium and proud father of two little girls.
I like Software Development and Architecture, especially Java and it's ecosystem, but also other things like coffee, mountain biking, yoga, travelling, reading, ...

![That's me!](/assets/profile.png)

Here's my [CV](/assets/CV_Benoit_Dupont.pdf) and in the next section, a more comprehensive list 
of projects and technologies that I did in the past.

I especially love 
* developing on the backend side of applications, that's where there are the more interesting challenges for me 
* the book Clean Code which brought me many things to improve my development skills
* the Open Source philosophy, which is a great way to achieve software quality
* the Testing Driven Development, that I cannot avoid using anymore on my projects
* the Agile methodology, which, when applied without exaggeration, avoid a lot of tedious procedures and focus on code delivery
* pair programming and peer reviewing, because working together with other people is so efficient and an opportunity to grow professionally
* remote working, because we loose everyday too much time with commuting, it bring interesting challenges and allow us to work with people from anywhere

# What cool projects did I do ?
